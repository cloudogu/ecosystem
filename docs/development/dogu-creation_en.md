## How to create a dogu
### 1. Create dogu directory
Create directory /ecosystem/containers/'newDoguName' and place these essential files into it:

 * `Dockerfile` --> Creation of the Docker image of your new dogu
 * `startup.sh` --> Commands executed at every start of the dogu
 * `dogu.json` --> Important dogu configuration information

For additional resources of the new dogu, a `resources` folder can be created.
### 2. Fill files with content
#### Dockerfile
 * Fixed commands, which only need to be executed once are included here
 * Guidelines for writing Dockerfiles can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/). 
 * For Java-based applications use the cloudogu `java` base image
 * For other applications use the cloudogu `base` base image
 * If your dogu is a web application, add the line `ENV SERVICE_TAGS webapp`. This will lead to the appearance of your dogu in the warp menu.
 * Copy your resources to the dogu, if necessary
 * Please include `MAINTAINER` information

#### startup.sh
 * Commands, which need to be executed at every start of the dogu are included here
 * Create or modify files and directories if necessary
 * Run commands necessary at first or every start
 * Add a command to start your application at the end of the file

#### dogu.json
 * Name: The name of the new dogu
 * Version: The version of the new dogu
 * DisplayName: Full name of this dogu
 * Description: Short description of the software in this dogu
 * Category: The ecosystem category your dogu fits into. Possible options so far: `Development Apps`, `Administration Apps`, `Documentation` and `Base`
 * Tags (JSON array): One-word tags related with this dogu
 * Logo: Link to logo image for this application
 * Url: Official website of the software in this dogu
 * Image: Path to the image in the cloudogu registry
 * Dependencies (JSON array): List of dogus this dogu depends on
 * ExposedCommands (JSON array):
 * HealthChecks (JSON array): 
 * Volumes (JSON array): Directories in the ecosystem, which are also accessible from inside the dogu
 * Volumes-> Volume-> NeedsBackup (bool): Indicator for the backup. Set to false when volume data is not important for backup
 * ServiceAccounts (JSON array): 

### 3. Create your dogu
 * Start up ecosystem
 * Go to /vagrant/containers
 * Type `cesapp build 'newDoguName'`
 * If the dogu is successfully built, type `docker start 'newDoguName'`

### 4. Test your dogu
 * Check /var/log/docker/'newDoguName'.log if dogu is started up correctly
 * Restart your dogu via `docker restart 'newDoguName'` and check the log again
 * Make sure all bash scripts comply with the [guideline](bash-guideline.md)
