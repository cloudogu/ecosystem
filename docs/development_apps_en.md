In principle, this dogu can also be called anonymously without entering any login data on the login page of the Cloudogu EcoSystem.
If an anonymous call is to be made, it must be ensured that the resources to be queried (e.g. repository in the SCM manager or Nexus artifacts) have been released for anonymous access.
